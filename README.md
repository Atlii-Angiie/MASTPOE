Changes I have made from part 2.
I first edited my code and removed the errors that were there then after that I started with my part 3, I added the average price for each courses on my home page and also I added a add dish button that leads to a separate scrren, that screen allows the chef to add a dish by adding the name, the description, the price and also can select which course it falls under then they must click on the add dish button and that will store the information added in an array and the dish added will show below the button. The chef can also remove the dish by clicking on the remove button on the right hand side. 
Then on the hoempage there is a view details button, that allows the chef and guests to see or filter by course, for example when they click on the main course button it will show a screen of the meals under the main course including the price
